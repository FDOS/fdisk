BOOT LOADER INFORMATION:

Licensing of the boot loader code which came with BootEasy:

The bootloader code that I used was written by Serge Vakulenko.  I found
his BootEasy program in a distribution of FreeBSD.  There was no licensing
information that came along with the program; but, since the program
is with a FreeBSD distribution, it is logical to assume that it has at 
least the license that FreeBSD has.  This would enable me to re-use, modify,
and re-distribute his code at my convienience.

I also tried unsuccessfully to contact the author to confirm the licensing.

In conclusion, I am proceeding under the assumption that the license is a
FreeBSD license and using the BootEasy boot loader code as a replacement
for the MS-DOS boot loader code.  For more information on FreeBSD licensing,
please go to http://www.freebsd.org

Brief bootloader instructions:

When booting the PC with the BootEasy bootloader, you will get a screen
that lists the function key to press next to the operating system to boot.
Just hit the function key next to the desired installed operating system.
After you have booted the first time, the bootloader will wait for user
intervention for about 5 seconds; then, it will boot to the last operating
system that was booted.  The BootEasy bootloader will allow booting to 
multiple operating systems.
