INSTALL

This file needs updated.

Pre-requesits:

1.  Compile CATS and copy the catdb.lib file to the \source\fdisk directory.
2.  Copy the bootnorm.asm file to the \source\fdisk directory.
3.  Copy the booteasy.asm file to the \source\fdisk directory.

How to install the program from the source code:

To compile the source code you need:
1.  Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 or compatible.
2.  The included source code and header file for fdisk.exe.
3.  A PC running some form of DOS.  (Probably greater than MS-DOS 4.0.)

Instructions:

Note:  I used Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 as a compiler, the instructions will
       vary depending upon the compiler used.

1.  Run the GUI version of Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 by typing "tc"
2.  Make sure that your compiler is set to at least the "large" memory
    model.
3.  Go under "Project" on the menu bar at the top of the screen and open
    the fdisk.prj project file.
4.  Go under "Compile" on the menu bar and select "Build all."
5.  Exit from the compiler and you will have the executable.

OR

1.  Place all of the source code in one subdirectory.
2.  From the command line, type "make all".
3.  After compiling and linking, you should have the fdisk.exe file.

Optional:
Include the "part.ini" file in a directory in the PATH to give
the program enhanced partition type lookup capability.

Include the "fdisk.ini" file in a directory in the PATH to be able
to set some commonly used options.

Use the APACK program, by Jeorgen Ibsen, to turn the executable into a 
small, packed executable.  The command to do so is "apack -x fdisk.exe
fdiska.exe"  Then delete the fdisk.exe file and rename the fdiska.exe
to fdisk.exe.
