	Using a text editor, make sure that the VERSION statement in the
        fdisk.ini file is set to one of the following:

		VERSION=W95       Supports large hard disks without
                                  FAT32 partitions.
                VERSION=W95B      Supports large hard disks with FAT32
                                  partitions.
		VERSION=W98       Same as VERSION=W95B
	
	Also make sure that the fdisk.ini file is located in the same
	directory (folder) as Free FDISK.

        Optionally:  Set the FFD_VERSION statement in the environment to one of
                     the versions listed above by adding a "SET" statement to the
                     c:\autoexec.bat file.  i.e.  SET FFD_VERSION=W98
