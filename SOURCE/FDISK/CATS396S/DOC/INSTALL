This is the INSTALL file


To compile the libraries and the gencat program using Borland C 3.1:

 make -fmakefile.bc all

or if you have TurboC:

 make -fmakefile.tc all

You will see some warnings about unused variables when catgets.c is
compiled, but this is expected.  You can ignore those warnings.


To compile the test programs using Borland C 3.1:

 make -fmakefile.bc test

or if you have TurboC:

 make -fmakefile.tc test


To test, make sure you have set NLSPATH and LANG to their correct
values.  As an example, set NLSPATH to the location of the 'nls'
directory, and set LANG to the value 'pig'.  Then run CATS.EXE to see
what happens!

Note that the output from CATS2.EXE is totally independent of the
NLSPATH and LANG settings.  That's because it uses a hard-coded
filename for the language catalog.

To test the gencat program, use the NLS\cats.msg file.  This should
produce output that can then be written to a Cats file (such as
"cats.en") and loaded into your program.  Run the gencat program like
this:

  GENCAT ..\NLS\CATS.MSG >..\NLS\CATS.EN

or:

  GENCAT -o ..\NLS\CATS.EN ..\NLS\CATS.MSG

Type this for help in running GENCAT:

  GENCAT -?
